### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**sarahjstrong/sarahjstrong** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
I'm a creative enthusiast with a background in graphic design and marketing leadership. I'm a innovative and passionate software developer, recently graduated from Tech Elevator's full stack bootcamp. As someone who is easygoing and always up for a new adventure, I find joy in the journey of learning and embracing challenges.

Coding has become my latest adventure, where I merge creative flair with analytical thinking. My diverse experiences have forged a unique perspective, shaping me into an individual ready to contribute to innovative solutions in the tech space. Let's connect and explore opportunities that blend design, technology, and innovation. I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Outside of my career, I'm passionate about storytelling in literature and on screen. I'm an avid bookworm delving into fantasy, mystery, romance, and much more. As a film enthusiast, my ideal Friday night involves working through my watchlist (nods to A24 productions) and a bowl of popcorn. Beyond those interests, I'm committed to holistic well-being, exploring the connection between physical and mental health, with a keen interest in nutrition and staying active. I thrive in hot weather and sunshine, where you can find me hiking to the creek for a dip. Embracing the beauty of the outdoors, my ideal day is spent in nature.

I approach life with a perspective that sees every moment, whether filled with joy or grief, as a vital and beautiful part of our journey. Always on the lookout for beauty in every corner.

Cheers to the future and the next exciting chapter!
